Chapter 32
===========
Pig and pepper for the long people
Crumbs and course will lead their way
Moon and muchness for the tool people
Sticks and leaves shall call their king

There's the arch
And i've got to go back 
But it's shutting up like a jack
And in a moment, splash

The more sharpened the tools the more the calamity


The way is empty without being invited
Said the gryphon squeaking
But she had tired herself out
Whiskers for you 

A thing confusedly formed is no use in talking to
Said the white rabbit hastily
But it was getting very sleepy and stupid
Life among mad people

The sage meets with no jury
Said the king calamity
But he wasn't very civil
Leader in the air

A moment appears only ten inches high
Said the mouse with a melancholy tone
But it only shook its head
Circumstance a curious thing

Moon and memory
Sticks and dry leaves
formed before heaven and earth
muchness come on
the way is empty 
fly through the valley 
with purpose you shall meet the king

The way
Mix
