Silent Moon
============
I see you also
Your parts to fit
Like drapes the walls in black
And pack on a pillow
Staffs will call the duration of things
Drest in blue bearing

Dear camerado 
Sagacious eyes
Thy motion a cheerful axeman 
wielding all day
whirling like a whip and how
Whirling 
whirling legswhat fine

Proud allons
All bodies speed to the centre 
Streaming lookingo there
conceal'd by fields 
unshakable
Enflamed by objects 
irresistible
stinging with them now

The value itself there is 
As is
from all eternity to your part
A song o the old timbers
And to the boatman what belongs
Years to chant
Limitless to each all



dear camerado
how straight and square they stand
the cities draped in black
packed unshakable order 

pack
defects and excrescences
they fit well in his pack and pillow
basking two one side

continents north and east 
Pinnacles and excrescences
of earth the elements
nature 
and flames gigantic
make a song o the old timbers
proofwhatsoever
the boatman sings what belongs
the axeman cheerful wielding 
all day about nothing  
Whirling like a whip and now
Whirling
Whirling lookingo fine

Proud Allons of Elbruz 
Drest in blue bearing
Kazbek of Bazardjusi
Days will call the duration of things
And pillow dreams
curses gasps
lightly round his curv'd neck
transmitting the same law 
philosophs presidents propositions 
lxvi xviii

silent moon 
i see you also
you furnish your parts 
toward the future
