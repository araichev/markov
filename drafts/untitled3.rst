Shadow of my likeness 
gone to and fro
chaser of thy kind
sail and jib steer forth
wandering peering dallying 
truly and steadily pursued 

o these dazzling things
feeding and taking turns
minstrels minnesingers flocks of goats
singing all particulars
first to last comprised 
revolving in cycles 

Kill then thyself for the savans 
for the wonderfulness of insects
or for good eidolon in port
let them know your scarlet heat 
let it perish 
thou wilt but slay the slain

To live again
spirit deathless endless infinite 
now appear'd
now on high hill watching 
character of a free companion
Calm and cool realities
