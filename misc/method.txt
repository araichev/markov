Markov, a Game of Poems
========================
by Alex Raichev 2015-01

I would like to describe a method for writing poetry,
a kind of constrained writing that i adapted from an exercise in a computer programming textbook [footnote = Exercise 13.8 of _Think Python_ by Allen B. Downey] and quite enjoy.
I call the method *Markov, a Game of Poems*, because games are more fun than methods and because the game involves a Markov process [footnote: A Markov process is a random process that changes state according to a transition rule that only depends on the current state.
These processes are named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov (1856--1922) who first formalized and studied them as a result of analyzing poetry!].
I call a poem produced by playing the game a *Markov poem*.


Game
-----
Here's how you play.

1. Choose one to three source texts, each of length at least 500 words.

2. Chop the texts down to have equal word lengths, concatenate them, and perform the following analysis on the resulting text T. For each distinct contiguous pair of words (prefix) in T, make a list of the words that directly follow that pair (suffixes) in T. 
For example if your text is

    Beware the Jabberwock, my son! 
    The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
    Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun 
    The frumious Bandersnatch!

then the outcome of the analysis is...

    (Beware, the): [Jabberwock, Jubjub]
    (the, Jabberwock): [my]
    (Jabberwock, my): [son]
    (my, son): [the]
    (son, the): [jaws]
    (the, jaws): [that]
    (jaws, that): [bite]
    (that, bite): [the]
    (bite, the): [claws]
    (the, claws): [that]
    (claws, that): [catch]
    (that, catch): [beware]
    (catch, beware): [the]
    (the, Jubjub): [bird]
    (Jubjub, bird): [and]
    (bird, and): [shun]
    (and, shun): [the]
    (shun, the): [frumious]
    (the, frumious): [Bandersnatch]
    (frumious, Bandersnatch): []

Here each prefix has at most two suffixes: (Beware, the) has two, (frumious, Bandersnatch) has zero and the rest have one.
In a long text, some prefixes would likely have many more than two suffixes.

3. Create in stages a mix M of the text T as follows.

    a. Choose at random a prefix from your list and then choose at random one of its suffixes. These three words, prefix then suffix, are the first three words of M.

    b. Take the last pair of words of M, find it in you list of prefixes ---it must be there by design--- choose at random one of its suffixes, and add the suffix to M.
    If no suffix exists for that pair ---which happens if and only if you chose the last prefix in the list--- then chose a new prefix from the list and one of its suffixes at random.

    c. Repeat step b until M has length 500 words, say.

4. Write a poem such that each word is (i) a word with the same stem as a word in the mix M or (ii) a stop word. 
Regarding clause (i), the *stem* of a word is the root form of the word according to a natural language processing algorithm, such as the Porter algorithm; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming. For example, 'argue', 'argued', 'argues', 'arguing', and 'argus' all have the stem 'argu'.
So you can use the word 'argue' if any of its variants appear in M.
Regarding clause (ii), a *stop word* is a very common word, such 'a', 'and', 'the', 'with'; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_word for a list of stop words.
If you are using a non-English language, than you need to use stems and stop words appropriate to that language.

End game.  

As you probably noticed, steps 2 and 3 can be tedious for any text T longer than a few dozen words.
To make the game easier for us to play, i wrote a program that automates those steps and put it on my website at http://raichev.net/markov.net.
The program can also do the stem and stop word check of step 4.


Example
-------
OK, let's look at an example Markov poem, one by Auckland poet Lisa Samuels.

Lisa chose source texts from the following internet links:

- http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/will
- http://www.collective-evolution.com/2014/11/24/this-is-what-really-happens-to-your-body-when-you-practice-intermittent-fasting/
- http://wiki.geogebra.org/en/Move_Tool [list references not texts]

She then used the Markov website to produce from those texts the mix

    to have a wish or desire whether we will all do our best will you please stop that racket 2 —used to express inevitability accidents will happen 7 —used to express desire choice willingness consent or in negative constructions refusal no one would take the job if we will or no intermittent fasting is about timing your meals to allow for regular periods of fasting recommendations for allocating time throughout your day to go without food range from approximately 12 to 16 hours this would mean for example only eating between the hours of 11 am and 7 pm and doing so everyday there are other ways to do it and we will or no intermittent fasting is what you eat before and after you fast move tool is selected you need to drag it with your right mouse button move tool in the three dimensional coordinate system you can quickly activate the move tool in the article this does not mean binge eating and how you break that fast just as important in the article this does not mean binge eating and taking in vast amounts of junk food into your system during the times allocated for yourself to eat doing so would be extremely counter productive and very unhealthy in fact the whole practice of fasting can be lost with how you break that fast just as important in the 3d graphics view using the arrow keys see section manual animation note • you can quickly activate the move tool in the 3d graphics view drag and drop free points in order to move a slider when move tool by pressing the esc key of your keyboard • to move a slider when move tool by pressing the delete key • … delete the object by pressing the delete key • … delete the object by using the move tool in the article this does not mean binge eating and taking in vast amounts of junk food into your system during the times allocated for you to do so as well as what you eat before and after you fast move tool in the graphics view drag and drop free points in order to move a slider when move tool by pressing the delete key • … delete the object by pressing the delete key • … move the point • mode z axis without changing the z coordinate • mode x y plane without changing the z axis you may move the point parallel to the x and y coordinates button and range —used be point go y key the loaf 16 to unhealthy point move will z tomorrow nothing will work one day and loaf the next 3 —used to express desire choice willingness consent or in negative constructions refusal no one would take the job if we will all do our best will you please stop that racket 2 —used to express determination insistence persistence or willfulness i have made up my mind to go

Using the mix as her palette of words and suggestive phrases, she then wrote the following poem.

    Transubstantiation

    the junk object
    breaks your system
    eating you during the times
    you can ex-
    press desire
    nothing vast
    when you mode drop
    everyday you break
    yourself whole practice
    to have a wish or desire
    whether we will all do
    our best will you please
    racket arrow consent
    or in negative refusal no
    one would take the job if
    your right move tool
    points free in order to
    time your will no inter-
    mittent drag allows
    a slider by the binge
    moves the point
    what you eat parallel
    to tomorrow without
    changing the mind to go
    in drop plane mode
    you eat the loaf

As you can check by hand or using the website, Lisa did indeed write a Markov poem corresponding to the mix, that is, her poem satisfies clauses i and ii of step 4.


Invitation
-----------
That's it.
If all that sounds interesting, then i invite you to play Markov, A Game of Poems at http://raichev.net/markov.
Enjoy!
