{"poem": "As if the sun was withdrawing\nIn the last book of an evening\nWith a few feet distant\nAs if laboring\nWith some remote horizon\n\nI heard a prudent man found himself\nPlanning and contriving\nAgainst his will\nAll dark-colored\nAnd saturated with dew\n\nI saw the axe out again\nI heard him express wonder\nHis gnarled rind serving\nThe god of loons\n\nSnapping the air\nPressed by a spring fire\nBurst from the point of a belt\nAnother year's life\nGone and come with a smile\n\nAnd the course to the pond\nWe should be so idle\nTo try all that we are\nAt length\nAt any rate\n\nTo cut off the top\nOf the thick woods south\nTo fain turn over\nUnobscured by weeds\n\nTo know the hall\nKnow them breaking ground\nVillage and trowel\nFishes and judges\nJudges and jays\nWind away\nWind away\n", "sources": ["Walden by Henry David Thoreau", "Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carrol"], "date": "2014-04", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "mix": "Lost", "title": "Course to the Pond", "author": "Alex Raichev"}
