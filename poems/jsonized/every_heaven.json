{"poem": "Give us time to reflect\nWhat is life \nWhat is the content of our friend or wife \nFrightened of something\nWe become what we utter\nVehicular and transitive\n\nAll symbols are fluxional\nThe mind will find a rational explanation \nAnd plunge itself into every partridge, fox, squirrel, and mole\nAnd in the woods and waters roll\n\nBut what is holistic? \nWhat is the soul? \nWhat arises from night?\nWhat is history but an optical illusion \nAbout every person we meet\n\nSee \nThe foaming brook \nWithout compunction\nOur problem in the whole movement of thought\nMust inevitably fall in its right place\n\nWherever are forms with transparent boundaries \nWherever are forms with transparent boundaries \nWherever are outlets into celestial space \nWherever is stillness and awe \n\nThe Caliph Ali is seeking after thee\nTherefore be at rest from seeking after thee \nTherefore be at rest from seeking after it \n", "sources": ["Essays by Ralph Waldo Emerson", "Talks by Jiddu Krishnamurti"], "date": "2014-04", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "mix": "Lost", "title": "Every heaven is hung by clouds or sown with stars", "author": "Alex Raichev"}
