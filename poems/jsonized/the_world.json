{"poem": "A global dimming\nToward the reddening west\nA gradual reduction\nTo its narowest part\n\nOne generation abandons the enterprises of another \nLike a burning glass on the alert\n\nWhat youth or maiden conspires \nWith the street\nThe corporation hides \nA multitude of sins\nAnd lies in broad daylight\nWhen they called for policies\n\nThe animal is dying\nAnd the richest \nThe faultfinder will find\nFlocks do hourly feed\n\nSay nothing of the hardness \nThough voices have waxed hoarse and solemnly grave\nMockingly mirth \nAnd resound with their own sufficience\n\nNo wit could divine where in the morning \nOur breakfasts were put through \nWithout accounting \nFor the passing day\n\nAn old woman that lives in the moonlight \nSustaining herself with clenched hands\nAs if the day is a ridiculous demand\nAnd the sincere life passed\n\nHer pains in this \nHe says that's good\nBut he has never made a study\nOf the game \n\nAnd the sights directed over one hand\nBy the rain which waters the beans\nIn the shadow of the rainbow\n\nMake no mistake\nI have contemplated those cases\nPerchance with watery eyes\n\nSea rise and short impulses\nThe most attractive and productive industry\nOf the last 800,000 years\nUnequalled fertility\nOf greenish reflections\n\nPlace a pailful in my house\nIt is not so much\nPerform something \nHowever umbrageous \n\nThe millions are awake enough \nTo refuse allegiance \nAnd let down their fine lines\nOf cant and hypocrisy\n\nThrough the illusive to the sacred \nLeap the wall\nThis duty has waited long enough\n", "sources": ["Walden by
