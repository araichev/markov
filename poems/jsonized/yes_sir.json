{"poem": "We are in the beginning of a lull\nAnd I have had an emotional experience\n\nVery calmly and very quietly I say\nAll right\nLook at Gunsmoke\nLook at the proletariat\nThe anarchy in production\nThe crying inequalities in the modes of producing and appropriating products,\nThat is bound to have an answer\nGet a Bible\nGet others\nGet the money\n\nThat is the bourgeoisie\nUse their life\nTake their time and labor\nThey smash to pieces machinery\nThey set factories ablaze\nThey seek to alter the character of production\n\nTherefore as the people who profess one thing\nOne social thing\nWe go\nBecause we take the name of God at the foot of the old property relations\nNot justified by faith\nBut cooking with gas now\n\nI say that's great\nI say that's great\nI say, Lady, if it's carried out in your place\n\nDissolution going on before our television sets\nSpending our time filling the night before\nI saw an inscription coming up this mountain\nTo the unknown God\nDo You believe in Christ?\nHave you really given yourself to Christ?\nDo You believe in Him?\nI can do!\nSee Romans 6:20-23\n\nWe take His name\nWe write it down\nThe Manifesto has become fully developed\nA new life of the state of society\nMinus its revolutionary and disintegrating elements\n\nAnd the heroes of modern American life?\nLearn more by watching than by reading\nWhy do you know what living was?\nI follow God and that place where the workers begin to form combinations\nTrades' Unions\nAgainst the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a nuclear war\n\nThat could be a revolution\nOn the floor of the Law\nAdministrative reforms based on class antagonisms be damned!\nNo flesh be justified!\n", "sources": ["Sermons of Billy Graham", "The Communist Manifesto by Karl Mark and Frederick Engels"], "date": "2014-04", "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0", "mix": "Lost", "title": "Yes Sir!", "author": "Alex Raichev"}
