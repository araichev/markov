title: The World
poem: | 
    A global dimming
    Toward the reddening west
    A gradual reduction
    To its narowest part
    
    One generation abandons the enterprises of another 
    Like a burning glass on the alert
    
    What youth or maiden conspires 
    With the street
    The corporation hides 
    A multitude of sins
    And lies in broad daylight
    When they called for policies
    
    The animal is dying
    And the richest 
    The faultfinder will find
    Flocks do hourly feed
    
    Say nothing of the hardness 
    Though voices have waxed hoarse and solemnly grave
    Mockingly mirth 
    And resound with their own sufficience
    
    No wit could divine where in the morning 
    Our breakfasts were put through 
    Without accounting 
    For the passing day
    
    An old woman that lives in the moonlight 
    Sustaining herself with clenched hands
    As if the day is a ridiculous demand
    And the sincere life passed
    
    Her pains in this 
    He says that's good
    But he has never made a study
    Of the game 
    
    And the sights directed over one hand
    By the rain which waters the beans
    In the shadow of the rainbow
    
    Make no mistake
    I have contemplated those cases
    Perchance with watery eyes
    
    Sea rise and short impulses
    The most attractive and productive industry
    Of the last 800,000 years
    Unequalled fertility
    Of greenish reflections
    
    Place a pailful in my house
    It is not so much
    Perform something 
    However umbrageous 
    
    The millions are awake enough 
    To refuse allegiance 
    And let down their fine lines
    Of cant and hypocrisy
    
    Through the illusive to the sacred 
    Leap the wall
    This duty has waited long enough

passing day this was not so deep but that i was surprised at its narrowest part of creation where i dwell i usually placed a pailful in my house is not so much to get made what i want the world would be the height of five eighths of it in his clothes is it wise to exchange his wigwam will be no mistake and then no wit could divine where in the morning our breakfasts were put through the indirect effect global dimming a gradual reduction in global mean temperature to below 20 °c 36 °f relative to the detriment of my statement notwithstanding much cant and hypocrisychaff which i helped to forward toward the reddening west with us and the realization of the pond and the sincere life passed within it who never knew them it will be earned if we had done and as quick as thought leaped the wall in the shadow of the rainbow over my person or smoothed out the smaller fry they do but what you are richest the faultfinder will find when they called for policies to reduce global warming227 walden economy when i was better than a dietetic point of view the constitution with all its translations has done all that one generation abandons the enterprises of another like a burningglass on the alert and heroic literary labors of men but what youth or maiden conspires with the street and lies there for a moment what most of it it is the process of establishing the most attractive and productive industry many a first spring day what makes this duty of hospitality waited long enough leaving him to me at all in this respect it is very selfish i have heard of bramins sitting exposed to the ground when he comes from looking at how temperatures at different levels in the streets i was ready to conform to the trunk in broad daylight i standing underneath in the animal is dying out

their old festal tables though their voices have waxed hoarse and solemnly grave mocking at mirth and resound with their own sufficient for its own culture but alas we do and they saw that a corporation of conscientious men is a charity that hides a multitude of sins the philanthropist too often successful when i came home to his ears out of his thoughts but must keep silence about it i finally went into winter quarters one afternoon and when thou seest the new mythology i don't know it we have many affairs a man that lives in the moonlight amid the woods completed and the smoothness of the hands would have performed something the millions are awake enough for her sustaining herself on humming wings with clinched talons as if the day is a ridiculous demand which england and live it from beginning to melt the snowbanks and the children's teeth are set on fire by english soldiers prisoners on parole and the detriment of the fishes that swim in it are old women over their heads
