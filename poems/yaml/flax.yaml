    i love him who desireth not to keep for himself 
    this simple model in area curves 
    for multiple organisms across (many archipelagos 
    demonstrate that island area in particular is a bridge and not a goal)
    
    i love him who loveth his virtue he is a rope stretched 
    between the animal and plant for thus seeketh he his own down going 
    
    i love him whose soul is lavish who wanteth no thanks 
    and doth not give back for he always bestoweth 
    and desireth not to keep for himself (in the same 
    direction as the impacts of colonization extinction) 
    
    i love him who loveth his virtue he is an over going and a 
    down going i love him who maketh his virtue thus 
    walketh he as spirit over the bridge
    
    larger islands will generate more species willing to live 
    on or live no more â€“ what is lovable in man 
    is that he may build the house and prepare for 
    earth animal and plant through island speciation
    for thus seeketh he his own down going 
    
    i love him who laboureth and inventeth that he is
    an arrow of longing for the other shore 
    i love him who liveth in order to know (the impact 
    of speciation on richness can be expected 
    to be in the same direction) i love those that know not 
    how to live on or live no more 
    
    (the impacts of colonization extinction 
    larger islands will generate more species 
    within the area richness well established) 
    
    what is lovable in man may hereafter arrive 
    i love him who reserveth no share of spirit for himself 
    but wanteth to be wholly the spirit of his virtue 
    his inclination and destiny thus for the other shore 
    
    what is lovable in man is that the earth may hereafter arrive 
    
    i love him who laboureth and inventeth that he is an over 
    going and an arrow of longing i love him who laboureth and 
    inventeth that he may build the house for the other shore 
    
    i love the great adorers and arrows of longing for the sake of his virtue 
    for virtue is more of a model even though it is more of a knot 
    for one's destiny is to cling to 
    
    i love him who laboureth and inventeth that he is a rope 
    over an abyss, a dangerous looking back a dangerous trembling
    and halting that he is a bridge and not a goal
    
    i love those that know not how to live on or live no more
