title: Signals Intelligence 
poem: | 
    A damnable business
    Continually and unreasonably 
    Searching our persons
    Against our wills
    Ay, against our common sense
    
    Travel on business
    They target you 
    Apply a cyberpeace tshirt
    They are inspecting things
    apt get install anarchism
    They no doubt smile
    The most usable tool
    Of a proprietary hardware 
    Or software device 
    An agent of injustice 
    To decentralized and free
    
    What was called to protect consider 
    Whether the remedy is worse 
    Than the evil it makes
    We know their intentions now
    Ratcheting power
    And it turns out the paranoid crazy talkers 
    Were not paranoid enough
    Sigint has infected us all
mix:
    "against their wills ay against their wills ay against their wills ay against their wills ay against their wills ay against their wills ay against their common sense and that's a good intro and i hope to meet some of them are sigint enabled that is that on balance when you hash the files and you can fab this device i held up here soon it sounds like if you're an american businessman or woman goes traveling somewhere that person is effectively targeted for signals intelligence collecting as much longer but he who gives himself partially to them useless and selfish but he that would not be broken when you make a decision but also where you can of course ask me questions the first blush of sin comes its indifference and from immoral it becomes as it would be selected and that is clearly the right to refuse allegiance to and support are undoubtedly its most conscientious supporters and so harass me and the state government directly and face to face once a passive thing where we don't know their intentions we don't know who she is and does as an example this device where the state's advantage is often android which is what we're doing for the random number generator you may consider whether the remedy is worse than the evil it makes it possible for us to build something secure with free software and free software if we could make debian if we could make debian if we were to have her train borne up and they can do all of these projects with the programs that are really important so that is to have ever lived really hit the nail on the one does not apply in which a man can abide with honor if any think that in an ideal world you had a neighbor and the simplest the most usable tool it actually allows you to their irc network which i'm very thankful for i found that even there there was a blunder for they thought that my chief desire was to stand the other side of that room for i found that even there there was a history and a purely brute or natural force that i can afford to be given him but the gnu project itself is a damnable business in which they are actively working to ensure that the respectable man so called collateral damage though i'm loathe to use those tools securely but it follows that if they knew how why give your neighbors this pain to treat them accordingly and not desire of rule or benefit i believe unreasonably searches through the power is once in the der spiegel at the very man i have a sim card is without a usable interface without having to worry about basically being attacked even if you use appropriate key sizes that's very critical because anytime you build a web browser it should be doing something wrong it is a damnable business in which the rule of expediency does not have many affairs a man and instrument to any other cause have nothing to hide underneath this great cyberpeace t shirt but it should have off the record messaging built into it if for example ratcheting so textsecure which moxie marlinspike those pieces of software really make a different choice than if you apt get install anarchism from time to save his life in such a government in which a free man can do to help anybody to be what is there that was called to protect and infect part 2 and i ought to be able to have bad habits so i like to think was paranoid crazy talkers were not made of india rubber would never manage to bounce over obstacles which legislators are continually putting in their village it was a wall of stone and mortar i felt like we didn't need tor or something that we need a lot of specialized knowledge again and this returns me sort of worth only as horses and dogs yet such as i can look at free software developer and you're not an american businessman or woman goes traveling somewhere that person is inspecting things it's taking notes rather the philosophy too much on his guard in such a case shall lose it this people mean well they are obliged to earn nine shillings from the state when it is an led that if one honest man in the operating system which is not let's say your phone number as one of our standardization agencies they're not just the nsa has toolkits that they have no doubt that it will do man in the present posture of affairs the indispensablest mode of treating with it that you will be the agent of injustice to a limited monarchy to a proprietary hardware or software device so that the world and then forever just keeping that identifier and then at one another as if i could not but smile to see my native town i began to comprehend what its inhabitants were about in the same things that we need to do with the tor hidden service which i've also set up you can program your device to self destruct but you can read about the philosophical texts of anarchism is about power it's about having a private sphere in which the people would not wholly a brute force but partly a human force and consider that i use a free software community builds decentralized or federated solutions and works really on solving problems of the things that i've seen when looking through and understanding some of you have all free software and proprietary hardware so as an example i think again this is the right to be called as he observed who went in a democracy is a sort of humbling experience the tails operating system which is proprietary software now the changes are different now people report on each other as"
