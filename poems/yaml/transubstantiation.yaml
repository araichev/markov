    the junk object
    breaks your system
    eating you during the times
    you can ex-
    press desire
    nothing vast
    when you mode drop
    everyday you break
    yourself whole practice
    to have a wish or desire
    whether we will all do
    our best will you please
    racket arrow consent
    or in negative refusal no
    one would take the job if
    your right move tool
    points free in order to
    time your will no inter-
    mittent drag allows
    a slider by the binge
    moves the point
    what you eat parallel
    to tomorrow without
    changing the mind to go
    in drop plane mode
    you eat the loaf
