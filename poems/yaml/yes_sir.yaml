    We are in the beginning of a lull
    And I have had an emotional experience
    
    Very calmly and very quietly I say
    All right
    Look at Gunsmoke
    Look at the proletariat
    The anarchy in production
    The crying inequalities in the modes of producing and appropriating products,
    That is bound to have an answer
    Get a Bible
    Get others
    Get the money
    
    That is the bourgeoisie
    Use their life
    Take their time and labor
    They smash to pieces machinery
    They set factories ablaze
    They seek to alter the character of production
    
    Therefore as the people who profess one thing
    One social thing
    We go
    Because we take the name of God at the foot of the old property relations
    Not justified by faith
    But cooking with gas now
    
    I say that's great
    I say that's great
    I say, Lady, if it's carried out in your place
    
    Dissolution going on before our television sets
    Spending our time filling the night before
    I saw an inscription coming up this mountain
    To the unknown God
    Do You believe in Christ?
    Have you really given yourself to Christ?
    Do You believe in Him?
    I can do!
    See Romans 6:20-23
    
    We take His name
    We write it down
    The Manifesto has become fully developed
    A new life of the state of society
    Minus its revolutionary and disintegrating elements
    
    And the heroes of modern American life?
    Learn more by watching than by reading
    Why do you know what living was?
    I follow God and that place where the workers begin to form combinations
    Trades' Unions
    Against the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a nuclear war
    
    That could be a revolution
    On the floor of the Law
    Administrative reforms based on class antagonisms be damned!
    No flesh be justified!
